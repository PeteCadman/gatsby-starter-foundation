<p><strong>What do I do if a swarm of bees is in my garden?</strong></p>

<h3 style="color: #30cc30; font-size: 28pt;">Don't panic!</h3>
<p>Bees in a swarm are at their most docile and are highly unlikely to sting anyone.</p>
<p>A swarm is a natural process for bees to expand their numbers. They have laid a new Queen in their previous colony and the old Queen is accompanying her old bees to a new home. It's 'holiday-time' and prior to swarming the honey bees will have filled up on honey from their stores and are totally content, prepared for a longish wait.</p>
<p>Because the bees are so full of honey they will be relatively passive and less likely to sting. They will hang in a cluster, usually on a tree branch, whilst they send out scout bees to look for a new home.</p>
<p>However, the scout bees may decide that their perfect new home is your household cavity wall, chimney, rabbit hutch, gas meter box or somewhere where you really do not want them.</p>

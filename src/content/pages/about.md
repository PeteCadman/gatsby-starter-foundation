Thank you! Now say "nuclear wessels"! No! Don't jump! A sexy mistake. Anyone who laughs is a communist!

A true inspiration for the children. And when we woke up, we had these bodies. Moving alongâ€¦ Do a flip! Michelle, I don't regret this, but I bth rue and lament it.

<!--StartFragment-->

<p><strong>East Dorset Beekeepers Association covers, as its name implies, all areas in the eastern end of the county. We are affiliated to the Dorset County Beekeepers Association and also to the British Beekeepers Association.<br>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The Association tries to help members by organising training whatever the level of experience, a programme of indoor meetings in the winter and practical demonstrations at our apiary in the open season. The Association also forms a platform where beekeepers can meet to discuss and follow up their common interest.</p>

<p>EDBKA produces its own quarterly newsletter which you will receive by email. In addition (if you have joined as a Full, Partner or Junior member) there is a County magazine, <em>Honeycraft</em>, which you will receive monthly as well as the British Beekeepers Association monthly magazine. You will also be allocated a BBKA membership number which allows you access to their website and other organised events. The Association possess two honey extractors which members can borrow for a modest charge to enable them to extract their honey crop.</p>

<p>Our winter meetings are held at the Broadstone Community Centre, which is central for the area we serve. We have an apiary at West Moors where we carry out training and demonstrations when members will have every opportunity to learn or fine tune their bee handling and hive management. New members, without bees, will be encouraged to attend our six-week training course in February, March and the beginning of April. After that they will be allocated a 'Bee Buddy' to advise on setting up their apiary and to help and guide them through their first year. New members will be given priority for the receipt of bees from our active swarm collection team from May until August.</p>
